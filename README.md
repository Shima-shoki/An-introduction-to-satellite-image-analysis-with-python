# An-introduction-to-satellite-image-analysis-with-python
This is a collection of tutorials of satellite image analysis with python. 
The contents are:
## Introduction 1: 
- Python basics
## Introduction 2:
- How to understand the metadata of the satellite images
- How to read band images as numpy arrays
- How to show a satellite image with arbitrary combination of bands
- How to calculate NDVI values
- How to write a geotiff file
## Introduction 3:
- How to clip an image by a rectangular shape of ROI
- How to resample an image to a target resolution
- HHow to calculate and create a principal component (PC) based image
## Introduction 4:
- How to read multiple satellite images
- How to specify the location on a numpy array from a geographic coordinate of a point.
- How to show a time-series change of NDVI at a specific location




**The sentinel-2 images attached to the repository is resampled to have a 60 m resolution, not 10 m or 20 m resolution which are mentioned in the code.**
Since I'm not very much familiar with GitHub, I couldn't upload the full resolution satellite images that are too large to do so. I added a code for the google earth engine (GEE) to download sentinel-2 images as geotiff files that are used in the tutorial. Please kindly modify some of the parameters in the GEE download code to find the target images you're looking for. Sorry for the incovinience!
